	Here is my attempt at the Miranda class, USS Reliant. Originally from ST-II:Wrath of Khan, it has been redressed and appeared almost everywhere else. I have based it off the plans in 'Ships of the Star Fleet: Vol 1'. I used Eric Peterson's superlative Enterprise as a base and built the other parts.
	I have included the Rego object for the lettering - I have still to add the lower Primary hull lettering as well as the nacelle an roll-bar lettering - but it still looks pretty speccy as it is.
