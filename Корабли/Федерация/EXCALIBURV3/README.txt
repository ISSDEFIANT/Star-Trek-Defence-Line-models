Please note this is the reduced texture version of the Excalibur. The whole folder reached over 50 megs when i finished it, and 26meg zipped. So to lower this to the 11meg download the textures have been reduced in quality, enough so that you cant zoom and see directly into a window, but not enough that the textures are a blur. If anyone is crazy enough to want the set of full textures, i am uploading them to the Excalibur site soon.

The Excalibur Class (due to demand) now has it's own website at http://excaliburclass.tripod.com

NACELLE CHANGING (from green to blue, for the conservative purists out there who dont want a slipstream enabled feddy vessel) :P ;)
There are 2 ways to do it, one is simpler than the other.
1) (simple version)
delete the "nacelle_green.jpg" and rename the "nacelle_blue.jpg" to "nacelle_green.jpg" before opening the Excalibur file in max.
2) (the slightly harder way)
simply change the file in the material manager.......

Special thanks:

To Nanogator, who was the great person that thought of the idea of reducing colour depth to the textures instead of decreaing their size. If it wasnt for that idea, the Excalibur would either be a 25meg download or a rubbish textured ship.... 

To Kenny, Mike (euphoria), Jon, BBT, Mvang, J, Braxton, Baz, Valiant, David J Lindsay, and everyone else who came along to the forums over the last few months and gave me so much support through the monotonous task of detailing the whole of the vessel.
Also for you guys pushing me when i needed it, and saying all the nice things you have.

Special Thanks also to Cyberbob, without whoose help this mesh wouldnt be on the net. (hosted and uploaded by him. Owe ya one!) :)

Authors final word
If your reading this, i hope you enjoy the mesh and create some brilliant images with her. She's a big file, but if your computer can handle her, you can create images of amazing beauty with her.

Since i created the original Excalibur, i've been stunned by the amounts of people who have continually shown such an interest in it. Kenny's shown me links to amateur online comic strips of Star Trek where people have drawn adventures of an Excalibur vessel (if anyone does re-discover that link, i'd appreciate sending it to me), people have used it for countless sim groups, many have used it in fanfictions, lots have used it in their art galleries, and the animations of it that exist are really great.
Each week, even tho i hadnt updated the 3D Reload site for over a year, people kept emailing me asking about its stats, if they can use images from the site, if they can use their own made on theirs, if they can put it in this fanfiction, this sim group, that reference site, their 3D upload site. 
Im pleased so many people like it and share my enthusiasm for the original idea i had in creating it, ...of melding together the best elements of all the trek ships i liked and creating a powerful and huge ship for the future.

The ship itself takes design elements strongly from the Excelsior (the saucer and the front deflector dish/front hull, also strongly from the Sovereign (its undersaucer, overall shape, torpedoe launcers and sleek design), the Constitution (its bridge, first 2 decks and travelpod ports) the Miranda (its shuttlebays), the Galaxy Class (its windows design) and also incorporates its own additions, the dual warp nacelles (with nacelles top and bottom of each), its cutaway back and flat nacelle wings.

I dont know if there is another non-cannon mesh out there that has more of a cult status than the Excalibur, but the fans of this mesh and their support really are appreciated. I honestly never expected anything i made to get so much response from so many people.
To all that enjoy it, thanks. :)
