About the Model.
Thankyou for downloading my model of the Prometheus.  After a lot of problems (one involving me to have to totally redo the whole thing!) I finally finished.  The first version I nearly finished was a lot smaller as I hadn't made it seperatable.  Of course that means that this version is about three times bigger in size!  It took about a week and a half to make roughly, Phew!

If you are looking for conversion of my models then you might try visiting this site HTTP://trekmeshes.starfleet.ch as some of my star Trek models are available in 3DS format on this site.

With this file you should also have received the following files:

	Bussard.JPG			---	Texture Map

	Uss Prometheus.COB		---	Model File

If you have not received these files with this one then feel free to email me and i'll try and sort it out :-)

Now the SERIOUS Stuff.

This mesh is free for you to use in your own personal stuff, like creating pictures for webpages or making videos for your own pleasure, as long as you give me credit.  It is not to be used in commercial projects without my express permission.

Now that's over with have fun!
